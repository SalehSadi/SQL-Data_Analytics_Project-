/*
Purpose:
    - To measure the performance of products, customers, or regions over time.
    - For benchmarking and identifying high-performing entities.
    - To track yearly trends and growth.

SQL Functions Used:
    - LAG(): Accesses data from previous rows.
    - AVG() OVER(): Computes average values within partitions.
    - CASE: Defines conditional logic for trend analysis.

-- analyze the yearly performance of products 
-- by comparing each product's sales to both
-- its average sales performance and the previous year's sales

--- so we need order date as dimention and product, and as measure we need sales info ----
